- Asynchronous Programming
      + 
        loadPostsAsync (function (){
            // ...wait till the posts are fetched
            // ...do something with the posts
        })
        doTheNextThings();

        -> Doesnot have to wait till untill the post loads

- Synchronous Code 
      + 
        posts = loadPostsSync();
            // ...wait till posts are fetched
            // ...do something with the posts
        doTheNextThings();

        -> We wait untill the post are fetched (Dependent on Bandwidth and slows this process)

- Most Async Code We work Comes from the API Lib
      + XMLHttpRequest & fetch
      + jQuery Ajax, Axion, other HTTP Lib
      + Node.js (file System ) module

- There are few ways we work with Async Code

      + Callbacks
      + Promises
      + Async/Await
